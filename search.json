Along with connecting to the WiFi with the WiFi key provided by the Computer Center, you need to also set a setting known as the proxy server.\nThe proxy server basically acts as an intermediate hop before your data reaches the internet. You can’t bypass the proxy server unless you use a VPN. We need to tell applications which proxy server to use."

    "text": "Linux\n\nGlobal\nThe method is largely similar to the windows way. Open settings, search for Proxy and set proxy.\nInstructions for GNOME and KDE. If you use the default DE of Ubuntu, you are probably using GNOME.\nIf you aren’t using a DE, but rather relying on a WM like i3, then you will also need to set the environment variables in /etc/environment, and log out and log back in every time you need to change the proxy settings, or at least stop the WM, run source /etc/environment and start the WM again. If this gets annoying, check out the Expert Tips sectionThis is because all children processes use the same proxy settings as the parent, and changing the proxy settings isn’t enough to change your WM’s environment variables. For a much more detailed explanation and Tips and Tricks, see the archwiki page on proxies. Read it, its useful.\n\n\nShell\nAlmost all Linux applications, especially command line applications use the following envars. Simply paste this in your .bashrc or equivalent, making sure to replace ip and port.\nexport http_proxy=\"http://ip:port/\"\nexport ftp_proxy=\"ftp://ip:port/\"\nexport rsync_proxy=\"rsync://ip:port/\"\nexport no_proxy=\"localhost,ip/32,192.168.1.1/32,::1,*.local,.ts.net\"\nexport HTTP_PROXY=\"http://ip:port/\"\nexport FTP_PROXY=\"ftp://ip:port/\"\nexport RSYNC_PROXY=\"rsync://ip:port/\"\nexport NO_PROXY=\"localhost,ip/32,192.168.1.1/32,::1,*.local\"\nexport https_proxy=\"http://ip:port/\"\nexport HTTPS_PROXY=\"http://ip:port/\"\n\n\nFinal thoughts\nSetting the proxy settings via Settings and the envars should generally be enough for most applications. Some applications, notably, all browsers and Zoom, have an in-app way to set the proxy too."

    "text": "The thesis acts as a final step of the BS-MS course, and it is something of a pride to hold it in your hand after it has been printed. But the journey from your research notes to a final document is not easy.\nWriting a master’s thesis can be a challenging task, but with the right tools and techniques, you can make the process smoother and more efficient. One of the key elements of a well-written thesis is proper typesetting, which involves formatting the text, citations, references, and other elements to ensure clarity, consistency, and accuracy.\nTo help you with this task, there are several typesetting tools and software programs that you can use. These tools can automate many of the tedious and time-consuming tasks involved in typesetting, such as formatting citations and creating a table of contents. They can also help you to adhere to the specific guidelines and standards required by IISER or your Department.\nWe’ll focus on few tools, particularly Quarto, LaTeX and Word. We’ll provide a general workflow for each of these."

Use either of them, preferably Microsoft Word.\nMake sure the margins and template is correct BEFORE you start writing. Changing the margins and page size later can screw up the placement of images, and it is a pain to fix it later. The page size should be A4, and margins should be the Mirrored option.\nIf you are finding it hard to align images, put the image in Tight word wrap mode.\nDo not manually make image captions with text or text boxes. Instead, right click on the image, and click the option to Add an image caption, and add it like that.\nMake a List of figures by going to the References tab, and clicking Insert List of Figures. This table should be automatically generated. Do not attempt to make it automatically, because any changes in the image will force you to make many changes. Similarly make the table of contents\nIf you want short captions in the List of Figures instead of the complete caption, use the following work-around.\nDO NOT press a lot of Enters to complete the page to start the next chapter.
