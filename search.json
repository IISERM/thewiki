Along with connecting to the WiFi with the WiFi key provided by the Computer Center, you need to also set a setting known as the proxy server.\nThe proxy server basically acts as an intermediate hop before your data reaches the internet. You can’t bypass the proxy server unless you use a VPN. We need to tell applications which proxy server to use."

    "text": "Linux\n\nGlobal\nThe method is largely similar to the windows way. Open settings, search for Proxy and set proxy.\nInstructions for GNOME and KDE. If you use the default DE of Ubuntu, you are probably using GNOME.\nIf you aren’t using a DE, but rather relying on a WM like i3, then you will also need to set the environment variables in /etc/environment, and log out and log back in every time you need to change the proxy settings, or at least stop the WM, run source /etc/environment and start the WM again. If this gets annoying, check out the Expert Tips sectionThis is because all children processes use the same proxy settings as the parent, and changing the proxy settings isn’t enough to change your WM’s environment variables. For a much more detailed explanation and Tips and Tricks, see the archwiki page on proxies. Read it, its useful.\n\n\nShell\nAlmost all Linux applications, especially command line applications use the following envars. Simply paste this in your .bashrc or equivalent, making sure to replace ip and port.\nexport http_proxy=\"http://ip:port/\"\nexport ftp_proxy=\"ftp://ip:port/\"\nexport rsync_proxy=\"rsync://ip:port/\"\nexport no_proxy=\"localhost,ip/32,192.168.1.1/32,::1,*.local,.ts.net\"\nexport HTTP_PROXY=\"http://ip:port/\"\nexport FTP_PROXY=\"ftp://ip:port/\"\nexport RSYNC_PROXY=\"rsync://ip:port/\"\nexport NO_PROXY=\"localhost,ip/32,192.168.1.1/32,::1,*.local\"\nexport https_proxy=\"http://ip:port/\"\nexport HTTPS_PROXY=\"http://ip:port/\"\n\n\nFinal thoughts\nSetting the proxy settings via Settings and the envars should generally be enough for most applications. Some applications, notably, all browsers and Zoom, have an in-app way to set the proxy too."
